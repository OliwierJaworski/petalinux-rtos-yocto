## GPIO control using embedded linux 

This project demonstrates controlling the onboard LEDs of the PYNQ-Z2 via a custom AXI GPIO design. It includes steps for hardware design, UIO driver configuration in the device tree, and a user-space application that maps the GPIO memory to control LED patterns.
